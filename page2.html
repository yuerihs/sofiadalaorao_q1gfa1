    <p>
        My name is Sofia Dalaorao and i'm a 9th grader from PSHS-SMC.
        I chose Pisay because I want to help my family by accepting the scholarship to lessen our daily, monthly, and yearly expenses. My brother is my number one inspiration on why i chose Pisay. 
        He is currently 21 years old and he has cerebral palsy with epilepsy, and I want to secure our future by utilizing the opportunity here in Pisay.
